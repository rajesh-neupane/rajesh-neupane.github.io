## Overview
This project involves the analysis of massive datasets generated by robotic milking systems. The goal is to understand the complex relationships between milk production, environmental factors, and cow-specific events.

## Architecture & Tools
*   **Large Scale Pipelines:** Design of robust data management pipelines capable of handling high-velocity data streams.
*   **Cloud Architectures:** Utilization of cloud computing resources for storage and processing.
*   **Multivariate Analysis:** Correlating data points such as:
    *   Environmental variables (temperature, humidity)
    *   Cow events (health logs, calving)
    *   Genetic factors

## Outcomes
Providing actionable insights on how external and genetic factors influence the applicability and utility of robotic milking datasets.
