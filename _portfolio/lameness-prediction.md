## Overview
Lameness is a critical welfare and economic issue in dairy farming. This research utilizes **accelerometer data** collected from commercial settings to predict lameness events automatically and accurately.

## Methodology
*   **Data Source:** Large-scale commercially created datasets comprising sensor readings.
*   **Algorithms:** Implementation of various Machine Learning techniques, ranging from traditional classifiers to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Deep Learning models.
*   **Validation:** Rigorous testing against veterinary diagnoses to ensure model reliability.

## Impact
The project aims to enable early detection of lameness, allowing for timely intervention and reducing animal suffering.
