## Overview
Data collection in precision agriculture results in fragmented and messy data. This project focused on designing a highly optimized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to streamline the research process.

## Data Sources Integrated
*   Milking meters (Yield/Flow data)
*   Rumen sensors (pH/Temperature)
*   Accelerometers (Activity/Behavior)
*   Environmental loggers (Barn conditions)

## Pipeline Features
*   **Automated Merging:** Combining data from disparate sources based on timestamps and unique IDs.
*   **Cleaning Algorithms:** Robust error handling for missing values and sensor outliers.
*   **Readiness for Analysis:** Outputting standardized datasets ready for immediate statistical or machine learning analysis.

## Significance
This infrastructure significantly reduced the time spent on data preprocessing, allowing more focus on actual research and discovery.
