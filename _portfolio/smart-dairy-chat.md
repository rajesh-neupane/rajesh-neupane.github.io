## Overview
This project focuses on the **SmartDairyChat App**, a smart application designed to bridge the gap between complex dairy science and daily farm operations. The app leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide farmers with instant, data-driven insights.

## Key Features
*   **Interactive Q&A:** Users can ask questions related to herd health, nutrition, and breeding.
*   **Real-time Assistance:** Provides immediate recommendations based on current dairy science standards.
*   **User-Centric Design:** Optimized for ease of use in high-paced farm environments.

## Research Goal
To evaluate the usability and accuracy of AI-driven chatbots in disseminating critical dairy science knowledge to non-technical users.
