## Overview
This research explores the use of highly granular accelerometer data to predict and classify specific behaviors in beef cows within both commercial and research settings.

## Technical Approach
*   **Signal Processing:** Application of Low Pass Filters and aggregation techniques to clean noisy sensor data.
*   **Time Series Modeling:** Comparing the performance of various deep learning architectures:
    *   **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**
    *   **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
    *   **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)**
    *   **Transformers**
*   **Objective:** To determine the most effective model for behavior exploration and utilization in precision livestock farming.

## Results
The study provides a comprehensive evaluation of how different deep learning techniques handle high-frequency time-series data for animal behavior monitoring.
