I am **Rajesh Neupane**, a graduate researcher and teaching assistant at **Texas A&M University**, working in the field of **precision dairy management**. My research focuses on developing **AI- and sensor-based tools** to improve animal health, welfare, and productivity in modern dairy systems.

My current projects include:

* **Lameness detection**: Using computer vision and machine learning for the preclinical detection of gait abnormalities in dairy cattle.
* **Heat stress quantification**: Designing systems to estimate panting scores from video data to monitor animal responses under heat load.
* **Water efficiency in dairy cows**: Analyzing data from rumen bolus sensors to identify water-efficient cows and reduce water use in dairy operations.
* **Sensor development**: Building Arduino and raspberry pi based sensors for dairy farming industry.
* **Robotic milking efficiency**: Studying failed milking attempts, teat connection patterns, and automation performance.
* **Digital dermatitis detection**: Applying computer vision for early detection of hoof lesions to improve animal welfare.

In addition to research, I serve as a **teaching assistant for ANSC 107 and ANSC 108 (Basic Animal Science)**, where I support student learning, manage online accommodations, and lead discussions. I also actively participate in the **Nepalese Student Association at Texas A&M University**, helping to organize events and community activities.

I am passionate about combining **data science, sensor technologies, and animal science** to solve real-world challenges in livestock production. My long-term goal is to contribute to sustainable, resilient, and welfare-friendly livestock farming systems.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring agricultural innovations, engaging with community organizations, and reflecting on the future of **small family farms vs. corporate farming systems**â€”a topic I deeply care about in terms of food security and resilience.
